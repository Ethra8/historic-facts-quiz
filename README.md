**NOTE**: _Responsive images of the site automatically generated through [ui.dev/amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive). The tool is interactive, and you can view and scroll through all pages in all the types of devices simultaneously [here](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://englishgrows.com/history-quiz/index.html). I customized defect background-color attribute from amiresponsive site from black to whitesmoke, as my website is mostly in dark tones. I did it by changing the elements of the page, more precisely **class="bg-brand-coal"**._

## UI - FIXED NAVIGATION BAR
**The fixed navigation bar appears once the user clicks on the cta button "Start Quiz" on the middle of the landing page.**  
![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/history-quiz/assets/80659091/bd517cdf-2953-4585-a068-63915349c98a)

- The user is able to interact with the responsive navigation bar, fixed to the top while completing the quiz, on the contact page, and the 404 error page. So, even when scrolling down, the user can change the settings at any time. The navigation bar includes the following:
    * **LOGO** allows user to go to landing page when clicked.
    * **SETTINGS** include:
      + **Switch mode** from default ***dark*** to ***light*** anytime throughout the quiz.
      + **Audio** allowing the user to play or pause the audio by clicking to the audio icon. When the audio is off, the "sound on icon" is visible, and once the user clicks on it to initiate sound, the icon changes to a "sound off" icon, so that the user can click on it to pause the music. The audio is a "tension orchestra chords" (for more details refer to the correspondent [media credits](#media) section below).
    * **'RESTART QUIZ' button** allowing the user to restart the quiz, with a new random order of the questions, and displaying automatically the new "question 1", also setting the counters to zero.

## UI - LANDING PAGE
- On the landing page, there is only the header with the name of the page "History Facts Quiz", and a call-to-action button on the middle of the page to "Start Quiz". Once the user clicks it, the quiz automatically begins.
  ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/history-quiz/assets/80659091/845b1893-7ac6-40dc-b035-6595e5126e2d)


## UI - QUIZ
1. Once the user clicks on "Start Quiz" cta button on the landing page, the 1st random question is displayed, with three optional answers set in a list, where a button can be checked for each (a.k.a radio buttons).
  * **Dark mode**
    ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/history-quiz/assets/80659091/62408d49-91b0-4d1a-9097-0a719da3522a)

  * **Light mode**  
    ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/history-quiz/assets/80659091/64e06ebc-d187-4632-a866-a13ddc327cf2)

2. At the bottom of the question & options, are the points' counters. There is a counter for "correct answers" (dosplaying the points in green) and another for "incorrect answers" (displaying the points in red).
3. Once the user selects an option whithin the possible answers, and clicks on the "Check Answer" button, a small customized pop-up (a.k.a modal) appears, darkening the rest of the page to highlight it, stating whether the answer is correct, or incorrect, with a button at the bottom for "Next Question". The modal has th same design in both modes:
    * **Correct Answer**: The message in the pop-up reads "That's right!... You've got it!"
        + **Dark mode**  
          ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/history-quiz/assets/80659091/cc41cd70-7cf6-457e-bfe0-ea4db1179af9)

        + **Light mode**
          ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/history-quiz/assets/80659091/736af16d-f0f5-43ba-af00-8ed946ed57f8)


    * **Incorrect Answer** : The messase in the pop-up reads "Awww ... You got it wrong this time. The correct answer is: 'correct answer in full text'."
          ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/history-quiz/assets/80659091/313abf65-2272-4f9b-81e6-3ee82e7e934b)

4. As the pop-up appears, the counter updates, counting a point to the "correct ansswer" or "incorrect answer" counter, accordingly.
5. Once the user clicks on the "Next Question" button at the bottom of the pop-up, the next random question is displayed.
6. Once the user answers the last question, the button's text on the pop-up changes from "Next Question" to "Final Results".
   ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/history-quiz/assets/80659091/12f3311b-3a8f-4e1d-9b45-22ab88a9c36e)

7. Once the user click on the "Final Results" button, a container with the same design as the questions appears, to give the user a seamless experience depending on the mode selected (dark or light) with a conditional text in it, and the total amount of correct answers out of the total of ten questions:
     * If the user's final result is of 3 or less correct answers, the final results title reads "You could do much better ..." with the user's final result stated below as "Your final score is x/10".
     * If the user's final result is of 4 or 5 correct answers, the final results title reads "You could do better ..." with the user's final result stated below as "Your final score is x/10".
       + **Light mode exmple**
         ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/history-quiz/assets/80659091/90998abb-cf88-4ba9-a6d1-de16b93caaf8)

     * If the user's final result is of between 6 and 8 (included) correct answers, the final results title reads "Well done!" with the user's final result stated below as "Your final score is x/10".
       + **Dark mode example**
         ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/history-quiz/assets/80659091/40f61915-3938-4c06-b131-2432a7ac8b08)

     * If the user's final result is of 9 or 10 correct answers, the final results title reads "Wow! Do you have a PhD in history?" with the user's final result stated below as "Your final score is x/10".

## UI - FOOTER
- The footer is set to be fixed at the bottom of each page, and allows the user to interact at anytime, even throught the quiz, by clicking on the media icons in order to visit the correspondent social media page, and eventually follow the site on these platforms to be aware of any new feature implemented, or new quizes uploaded.

### COLORS RATIONALE OF USE
The dark mode was coded first of all, so all colors selected at firstm aimed to match the Milky Way sky background, such as *Oxford blue*, or bring contrast, such as *aquamarine*, or *whitesmoke*. *Palatinate* purple was combined with aquamarine for main titles and logo, as a nice text-shadow for the aquamarine title and logo.  
Once the light mode was implemented. *onyx* was selected to bring clear contrast on *whitesmoke* background containers used for the questions.

- [Roboto condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed?query=roboto) - Has been used for each question's text and options.

### TYPOGRAPHY RATIONALE OF USE

Placed in the middle, there is also the "go to home page" button allowing the user to redirect to the home page, and the footer is also displayed at the bottom, allowing the user to interact with different social-media platforms, or to send an email to the admin.

## FUTURE FEATURES
The following features have not yet been implemented due to constraints, but will very likely be implemented in a near future as to boost this site's purpose and user UX.
### INCLUDE DIFFERENT TOPICS CATEGORIES
On the home page, different topic categories will be offered to users. The "Start Quiz" button will therefore be replace by different buttons representing the different topics available (e.g. "History", "Climate", "Biology", etc.). Users who are still not members will be able to access one quiz from each of the available categories.
### MEMBERSHIP BY MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION
Users will be able to create an account, by a symbolic monthly subscription that will allow them to create and save their own quiz, and access all the other quizzes posted from different subjects.
### USER CAN CREATE OWN QUIZ
Members will be able to create their own quiz by completing a series of inputs which values will be stored as variables. This new quizzes will be stored in the user's account, and a link created so the user will be able to easily access them and/or share.

## MANUAL TESTING

### BUTTONS, SWITCH AND ICONS
All buttons of this site have been tested, and work exactly as expected:
1. **"Start Quiz" button** on home page, starts the quiz by displaying 1st question.
2. **"Restart Quiz" button** on the navigation bar restarts quiz anytime the user clicks on it, displying a randomized 1st question, and setting the counters to zero.
3. **"Check Question" button** displays the modal with a message to the user whether it was a correct/incoorect answers, and the correct answer gets displayed if the user clicked of the incorrect answer, so that the user can learn from his/her mistakes
4. **"Next Question" button** on the modal displayes the net randomi zed question of the quiz once the user clicks on it.
5. **Radio Buttons** for the three optional answers. Only one radio button can be clicked at a time, and user has to click one of them to proceed with the quiz. In case the user clicks on the "Check Answer" button without having previously selected a radio button corresponding to an answer, the quiz will not advance.
6. **Sound Icons** on the navigation bar only display one at a time. When sound is off, the "sound on" icon displays, and once the user clicks on it, the music starts playing, and the icon is changed for a "sound off" icon, and so on.
 
### QUIZ
The quiz functionality has been manually tested and works seamlessly in both modes (dark and light), even allowing the user to change mode settings at each question, if desired. Please refer to the following table, and video:
[x] Questions are randomized
[x] Correct and incorrect answers are successfully added to the correspondent scores.
[x] User can switch from dark mode to light mode anytime throughout the quiz without affecting the question content nor the scores.
[x] Only one radio button can be clicked at a time, and one must be clicked as for the "Check Answer" button to proceed, by displaying the modal.
